# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is "a tiny little machine", it's job is to take your variables and do 'something' to them, you would use a function when you have information that you need to manipulate, calculate or access,for example: two numbers that need to be compared in some way, creating a grading scale, manipulating a list of data etc.

  Researched answer: Functions are an essential piece of JavaScript, they allow you to calculate, interpret and manipulate data and are a cornerstone of creating functional code (pun very much intended). A function takes some kind of input and returns the output you need from it based on the parameters you establish, you can use functions to compare numbers, complete calculations, sort and manipulate data and they can be called on as many times as you need once defined.



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: To be completely honest, I still have trouble keeping these two ideas separate in my mind but the parameters are the pieces of information fed into the argument to determine a result. For example, 42 would be a parameter in the argument 42 >= 12.

  Researched answer: In a function, the arguments are the data passed into the parameters defined in the function. In the function: const functionExample = (num1, num2) - num1 and num2 are the parameters established, you can then pass in any number as an argument and the output returned will be determined by the numbers in the argument: console.log(functionExample(42,12)).



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the location of a value, the value is the information held at the location of the index. 

  Researched answer: An index holds a position starting at 0 and can be called on to give the location of a value, or the value held at a given location. For example in the string "12345" the index of the value 1, is 0 and the value held at index 1, is 2.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in method is a function built into javascript to manipulate or interpret data, 
  for example .length returns the number of characters in a string, .toUpperCase returns a string in all caps. The methods exist in javascript and can be applied to data in a function.

  Researched answer: Built-in methods are pieces of functional code that have been added to the JavaScript language. These methods allow you to accomplish tasks that are commonly needed. Built-in methods can modify content, return information about content, and can't be applied to all datatypes universally. For example, arrays have a number of built-in methods which are divided into two categories: Mutators and Accessors, the .reverse() method cannot be applied to a string, but you can apply the .split method to separate the string into an array which the .reverse() method can be applied to. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming consists of one driver, and one navigator. The pair works together to create a plan to accomplish a goal and build a working piece of code, but the driver is the one actually working in the code while the other half of the pair is giving feedback, catching errors and looking for opportunities to tighten up the code. This is not only important for problem solving and efficiency, but prevents problems that arise when two people are working separately in the same file.

  Researched answer: Pair programming requires open communication and offers a way to strategize, work through complicated problems and keep energy and engagement up while working. While it is essential to work together as a team, effective pair programming best practices are to have one driver and one navigator. The driver writes the code while the navigator works with them to look for errors, give feedback and keep the pair on task. A key component of successful pair programming is communication! The driver must communicate effectively with the navigator as they work, and the navigator must be able to communicate any issues they spot to the driver. It is a good practice to switch driver and navigator frequently, establishing time windows before getting started ensures that breaks and switches are built-in to your rhythm. 



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Pair programming was extremely helpful for me, each person I worked with had a slightly different approach and it helped me to learn different ways to approach a challenge as well as providing insight into creating a more efficient workflow for myself. At this stage of not really knowing what we don't know, I found it incredibly valuable to work through challenges with different people so that I could start training my brain to look for those different solutions as I continue to learn.
